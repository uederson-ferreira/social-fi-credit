The more positive engagement you create, the higher your score will climb!

## Using the Platform

### Checking Your Score

1. Go to the Dashboard to see your current Community Score
2. The score ranges from 0 to 1000
3. You'll see if you're eligible for loans and your maximum loan amount
4. Check the "Recent Activity" section to see what affected your score

### Requesting a Loan

Once your score is high enough (minimum 50 points), you can request a loan:

1. Go to the Loans page
2. Enter the amount you wish to borrow (within your limit)
3. Select the loan duration (7-90 days)
4. Review the interest rate and repayment amount
5. Click "Apply for Loan"
6. Sign the transaction in your wallet
7. Funds will be transferred to your wallet after approval

### Repaying a Loan

To repay your loan and maintain a good standing:

1. Go to the Loans page
2. Find your active loan in the list
3. Click the "Repay" button
4. Sign the transaction in your wallet

Timely repayments will increase your Community Score, allowing you to borrow larger amounts in the future.

### Investing in Pools

If you want to earn interest by providing liquidity:

1. Go to the Pools page
2. Choose a risk level that matches your preference:
   - AAA Pool: Lowest risk, lowest returns
   - BBB Pool: Medium risk, medium returns
   - CCC Pool: Highest risk, highest returns
3. Enter the amount you wish to invest
4. Sign the transaction in your wallet
5. You'll start earning interest based on the pool's performance

## Tips for Success

1. **Be consistent**: Regular positive interactions build your score faster
2. **Quality over quantity**: Meaningful contributions count more than simple likes
3. **Repay on time**: Late payments significantly impact your score
4. **Start small**: Begin with smaller loans to build your credit history
5. **Monitor your score**: Check your Dashboard regularly to see how your activities impact your score

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- **Wallet connection problems**: Try refreshing the page or reconnecting
- **Twitter connection issues**: Disconnect and reconnect your Twitter account
- **Transaction failures**: Check that you have enough EGLD for gas fees
- **Score not updating**: Score updates may take up to 24 hours to process
